# ADhoneypot
A AnyDesk HoneyPot Monitor that will publish connection attempt details to a MQTT server.

As it only monitors for connection attempts, you do not need to give out your password or accept the incomming connection.

Never give anyone access to your system unless you know excatly what you are doing. 

Not fit for general consumption. Really, I mean that. 

Only tested under Windows. 
You need python 3.10+ and paho (https://pypi.org/project/paho-mqtt/)
